description: Full setup — Homebrew, AeroSpace, config linking, macOS settings, app scan
---

Use the install-aerospace agent to handle this request.

Run the complete first-time setup: verify the repo origin, install Homebrew and
AeroSpace, disable Apple window tiling, link the config, set up the boom alias,
grant Accessibility permissions, discover apps, and switch to operational mode.

If the install-aerospace agent is not available, read the CLAUDE.md in the
project root and follow the First-Time Setup procedure (Steps 0-12).
